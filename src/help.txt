Building LuaCXX

Simply run `make` or `make build` to build LuaCXX with default settings.
LuaCXX only needs Lua's header files to build, and will search `/usr/include` by default for
the 3 lua header files : `lua.h`, `lualib.h` and `lauxlib.h`.

You can override the directory it searches for the headers in by setting `INCLUA`:
	make build ... INCLUA="/path/to/lua-headers"

Assuming that now the library is successfully built, we can now link it with a program ( you must link it with an actual lua library ):
	g++ ... /path/to/liblua.a /path/to/libluacxx.a
